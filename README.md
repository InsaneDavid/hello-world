Hi Humans!
I'm InsaneDavid. I'm a GISer now, but I'm not pretty interested in it. 
Programming, in my opinion, is the essential skill in the future. It just like the use of computer.
Nobody has imagine that the computer can be use this important and widely.
I'm not really want to jump into another field but i need the knowledge of programming to survive in the future competition in GIS industry. 
I hope I didn't bother you guys. 
Wish you all good.
